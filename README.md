## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running locally on your machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- `pip` and `venv`

### 2. Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/abdullahraja-rgb/Calories.git](https://github.com/abdullahraja-rgb/Calories.git)
cd your-repo-name
````

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment:**

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Set up your Environment Variables:**

  - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
  - Add your secret keys to this file:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY='your_super_secret_flask_key'
    NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID='your_nutritionix_app_id'
    NUTRITIONIX_APP_KEY='your_nutritionix_app_key'
    ```

**5. Initialize the Database:**

  - You'll need a way to create your database tables. It's recommended to have a small Python script (`init_db.py`) to set up the initial `cal.db` file with the necessary tables (`users`, `tracker`, etc.).

**6. Run the Application:**

```bash
flask run
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment on **Vercel**. The `vercel.json` file handles the build and routing configuration for a serverless Python environment. To deploy, connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and add your environment variables to the project settings.
